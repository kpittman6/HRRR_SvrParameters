Workflow:

1 - Cell Tracking
===========================
5-22 Manual CI POINTS (.pptx)
- the notated position of each cell on hourly composite reflectivity images from each of the three radars

5-22_Storms (REVISED) (.xlsx)
- The list of individual storms tracked on the .pptx document. 
- Has a storm ID code, Start and end time that 40+ dBZ composite reflectivity was present,
  The reason for storm demise (dissipate or merger, and with which cell)
  Which radar was used for tracking
  It has the approximate centroid location and time of storm initiation (the first timestep it had 40+ dBZ composite reflectivity)
  It also has the centroid location/time for each subsequent radar volume that the storm had 40+ dBZ CR

2 - QC Near-Inflow Points
===========================
QC_Cell_Tracks_Master_PostBuffer.csv
- 115 storms


5_22_VerticalProfs_QC_Grouped.csv
- 210 sounding points (by time, and lat/lon location); several other characteristics tagged
